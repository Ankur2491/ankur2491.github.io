<pre><code>Senior Technologist , Infosys Jan <span class="hljs-number">2023</span> – <span class="hljs-built_in">Present</span>
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Designed and implemented data models and services to facilitate the migration from a monolithic architecture
  to a microservices-based architecture.</li>
<li>Engineered a robust reconciliation framework leveraging Angular, Kafka, Express, and Node.js to efficiently
  detect and resolve data discrepancies during Day-0 migration.</li>
<li>Conceived and implemented an operations portal that incorporates a suite of testing utilities for evaluating the
  functionality of individual micro-services.</li>
<li>Java, springboot, Angular, Typescript, MongoDB, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Spinnaker.
<strong>Specialist Programmer</strong> , Infosys Aug 2019 – Dec 2022</li>
<li>Designed and implemented a user-event tracking npm library that streamlined data flow to analytics platforms.
  This initiative decreased data processing time by 40%, allowing faster decision-making for marketing strategies.</li>
<li>Created a tool to visualize JSON as flow-graph. This proved to be very useful for spotting the json-path of an
  attribute and reduced the overhead in analyzing JSON by 50%.</li>
<li>Redesigned specific components within a larger application, incorporating reactive programming principles and
  an event-driven architecture. This approach enhanced the scalability of individual services by enabling them to
  independently scale horizontally.</li>
<li>Java, springboot, ReactJS, MongoDB, Oracle, Kafka.
<strong>Test Engineer</strong> , Infosys Jan 2016 – Dec 2018</li>
<li>Created a scaled-down workload model to accurately predict and plan for the capacity requirements of a
  client-facing application.</li>
<li>Delivered a 50% throughput increase by optimizing server resource utilization through careful tuning of heap
  space, garbage collection strategy, and thread pool configurations.</li>
<li>Java, bean-shell, jmeter, MongoDB.</li>
